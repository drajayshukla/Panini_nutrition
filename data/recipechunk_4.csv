After the brownies are completely cooled, after an hour, cut them into neat squares.Serve the Eggless Beetroot Brownie along with a plate of Baked Potato & Peas Samosa with Phyllo Pastry and a hot cup of Masala Chai.

Lay a dish towel on a work surface and sprinkle it lightly with water. Thaw the phyllo dough package according the manufacturer’s instructions.Unroll the sheets on the towel and then cover it with a second damp dish towel. When unrolling them I encountered several cracks and cuts in the sheets.Do not panic. They are easily repairable and do not make any difference in the dessert.Melt the butter in a small saucepan. Brush a baking pan with melted butter. Take a sheet of phyllo dough and carefully spread it in the pan, folding the sheet in such a way that it fits the pan.Brush the layered sheet with butter and gently press it into the sides and corners of the pan.Lay another sheet on top and brush with butter. Do the same with the third of the sheets. Once 1/3rd of the sheets have been used, scatter half the nut filling over the layers.Layer another third of the sheets in the pan, buttering each one and pressing into the corners and sides.

I just liberally brushed the top layer and left it at that).So essentially, after every 3 sheets there is a nut layer for the baklava recipe.With a small knife, cut diagonal lines around 1/2-inch deep to mark out the shape. Do not press down too much when cutting.Place the tray in the oven and bake for around 1 hr 15 minutes (It took me exactly 1 hr) until golden brown in color.Method to make the honey syrupCombine the sugar and water in a saucepan and heat until dissolved, stirring occasionally. Pour in the honey and stir to combine.Boil without stirring until the syrup reaches a soft ball consistency (239F on a candy thermometer). This process takes about 30  minutes.To test the consistency without the thermometer, take the pan off the heat and dip a teaspoon in the syrup. Let it cool down for few seconds and then drop it in a small cup with water.Once dropped into the water, it should form a mushy ball.Remove the syrup from the heat and let it cool down to lukewarm temperature. Now add the juice from a lemon and the orange flower water or the vanilla extract.Method to finish the baklava recipeRemove the pan from the oven and immediately pour the cooled syrup evenly over the hot baklava.Pouring the syrup over the hot pastries enables better absorption.With the chef’s knife cut along the marked lines almost to the bottom of the pan. Let the pastries cool.Cut through the marked lines completely and carefully lift the pastries with a spatula and arrange them on a plate.Sprinkle the top with the reserved nuts and serve the Baklava for your parties and special occasions.
