Grease and preheat the iron pan until it is sizzling hot. When you sprinkle water on the pan; the water will sizzle and evaporate.Once you have the right heat on the pan; pour a ladle of the batter in a circular motion starting from the outer edges. The batter will sizzle and flow to spread itself. Fill in the batter where there are gap, but do allow the dosa to have a few tiny holes. There is no need to sprinkle oil to cook the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa.The Neer Dosa cooks very quickly; when you notice the top of the dosa is no longer raw, the Neer Dosa is cooked. The cooking process will take less than 30 seconds per dosa.Slide a flat spatula from the sides of the pan and fold the Neer Dosa into a half and then into another half to form a triangle. Place the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa on a platter and continue to make Neer Dosa’s the similar way.Make sure you place the Hibiscus Neer Dosa away from each other when they are hot; as they tend to stick to each other.
