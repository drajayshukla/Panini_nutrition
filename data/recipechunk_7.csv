","To begin making the Churros Recipe With Cinnamon & Sugar, we will first make the Churro dough.Combine the milk, water, butter, sugar and salt in a saucepan and whisk it well. Bring the mixture to a boil.Note if you are using baking powder - mix flour and baking powder together and keep aside. If you are using eggs, it it done later in the steps as mentioned belowAs soon as the mixture comes to a boil, turn off the heat and add in the flour. Mix well until there are no lumps. The mixture will thicken and form a dough. Note if using eggs, it has to be added at this stage following this process. While stirring the dough constantly, gradually beat the eggs into the dough using a hand beater which has a paddle attached or a wire whip. Wire whip will split the dough, but once the egg is combined, you can use your hand to knead it for a few seconds so the dough comes together. Heat oil in a deep frying pan, over medium-high heat until the oil reaches 170 C. Add a small piece of dough into the dough and it should slowly come sizzling up. Ensure the oil is not super hot.Meanwhile, spoon the churro dough into a pastry bag or a zip lock and clip one of its end. Fit in a large or medium size star tip to the bag.Directly pipe 4 to 6 inch length of dough into the oil and snip out/cut with scissors to trim the dough.Ensure you snip close to the oil surface to avoid splash.Pipe out 4 to 5 churro into the oil per batch based on the size of your frying pan.Deep fry the Churros, turning them around while frying, until golden brown. Ensure you fry on medium heat and not high heat, as the Churros need to get cooked from the inside.Transfer the fried Churros to a plate lined with paper towels to drain the excess oil.

Once done turn off the heat and set aside to cool. Once the onion mixture has cooled to room temperature, transfer it to a mixer jar and grind to a fine paste using very little water. Transfer this to a bowl and set aside. In the same, kadai, add the tomato puree, and allow it to come to a single boil, now add in the freshly ground onion paste and whisked yogurt, mix well, Now add the red chilli powder, garam masala, coriander powder, cumin powder and salt to taste.
