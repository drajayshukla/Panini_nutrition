In a large bowl add in 2 cups of whole wheat flour and some salt. Use your fingers and stir in the salt into the flour.Add water a little at a time and knead to make soft, pliable dough. Knead dough for a couple of minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth.Next we will add a teaspoon of oil to coat the dough and knead little more. You want a dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky.Next we will divide the dough into 14 to 16 equal portions. Cover the dough and allow the dough to rest until you the feeling ready.While the dough is resting, lets prepare the filling for the parathas. I am going to be using homemade paneer as it makes the parathas softer, but you can use store bought paneer as well.In a large bowl; add in the homemade paneer. Use your fingers or a fork and begin to crumble the cottage cheese. Next add in 1 large chopped onion, lots of chopped methi leaves, finely chopped green chillies, cumin powder, and salt. Combine all the ingredients well.Divide the filling into 10 to 12 equal portions. This process of dividing and keeping the portions of dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.Take a paratha dough portion dust it in flour and flatten it on the rolling board by pressing it down. Roll the dough out into approximately 3 inch diameter circles dusting with flour in between to prevent the dough from sticking to the surface. Place this rolled dough to the side.Take another dough portion, dust it with flour again and roll into approximately 3 inch diameter circle.Now place the a portion of the filling onto the circle and spread it evenly around. Next, take the other rolled portion of the dough and place it over the filling.Press and fold the edges so that the filling does not come out while cooking the paratha. Once sealed press down the paneer paratha with your palms to release any air pockets. And give it a gentle roll with the pin to even it out.

Continue to the remaining dough portions the same way.Serve the Stuffed Paneer Methi Paratha Recipe along with a Raita for a wholesome breakfast or dinner.
","To begin making the Paneer Methi Paratha Recipe, we will first need to make the dough for the parathas. In a large bowl add in 2 cups of whole wheat flour and some salt. Use your fingers and stir in the salt into the flour.Add water a little at a time and knead to make soft, pliable dough. Knead dough for a couple of minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth.Next we will add a teaspoon of oil to coat the dough and knead little more. You want a dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky.Next we will divide the dough into 14 to 16 equal portions. Cover the dough and allow the dough to rest until you the feeling ready.While the dough is resting, lets prepare the filling for the parathas. I am going to be using homemade paneer as it makes the parathas softer, but you can use store bought paneer as well.In a large bowl; add in the homemade paneer. Use your fingers or a fork and begin to crumble the cottage cheese. Next add in 1 large chopped onion, lots of chopped methi leaves, finely chopped green chillies, cumin powder, and salt. Combine all the ingredients well.Divide the filling into 10 to 12 equal portions. This process of dividing and keeping the portions of dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.Take a paratha dough portion dust it in flour and flatten it on the rolling board by pressing it down. Roll the dough out into approximately 3 inch diameter circles dusting with flour in between to prevent the dough from sticking to the surface. Place this rolled dough to the side.Take another dough portion, dust it with flour again and roll into approximately 3 inch diameter circle.Now place the a portion of the filling onto the circle and spread it evenly around. Next, take the other rolled portion of the dough and place it over the filling.Press and fold the edges so that the filling does not come out while cooking the paratha.

Using a spoon,  scoop out the seeds. You may need to also gently slice off a little from the bottom of the peppers, so as to flatten the peppers and stabilize them when placed upright.Next, line a baking tray with foil. Coat the peppers generously, on the outside with olive oil and line them on the baking tray, standing upright, with the open tops facing upwards. Place them in the oven, reduce the temperature to 180 degrees C and let them roast for 15 minutes, until they are partially roasted, but not cooked fully.

Allow the oven to continue to pre heat, so you can put the peppers back inside once you have stuffed them.Using a tablespoon, fill the peppers with the rice mixture, taking care to press it in and fill the cavity tightly.

Add water a little at a time and knead to make soft, pliable paratha dough.Knead paratha dough for a couple of minutes until the paratha dough is smooth and elastic. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth.Next add a teaspoon of oil to coat the paratha dough and knead a little more. You want a paratha dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky. Divide the dough into equal portions.Cover the ragi paratha dough and allow it to rest until you get the filling ready. The next step is to make the Paneer filling for the Ragi ParathaIn a mixing bowl, combine the grated paneer green chillies, freshly chopped mint leaves, salt to taste, cumin powder, Using your fingers again, mix all the ingredients well.Divide the filling into equal portions.This process of dividing and keeping the portions for paratha dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.The final step is to stuff the filling into the ragi paratha dough.Dust the ragi paratha dough in flour, flatten it with your finger and place it on a flat surface. Roll them out thin to approximately 3 inches in diameter.Take a portion of paneer filling and place it in the center. Next gather the sides of the paratha dough and bring them together. Remove the little excess dough which popped out when you brought them together. Press the filled ragi paneer paratha dough down.Dust the filled paneer paratha dough in some flour and roll it gently applying just a pressure. Roll it to desired thickness and proceed the similar way with the remaining portions of paratha dough and filling.Preheat skillet on medium heat and grease it with little oil. Place the filled ragi paneer paratha. Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over.Spread a little oil over the paratha and keep pressing the ragi paneer stuffed parathas while on the skillet to cook the paratha evenly from inside out.Do the flipping over process a couple of times until both sides get cooked, browned and crisp evenly. Make sure you cook on medium heat as it allows the Paneer Stuffed Ragi Paratha Recipe to get a crisp on the outside and yet soft texture.Once the Paneer Stuffed Ragi Paratha Recipe is cooked transfer to a plate.

Roll them out thin to approximately 3 inches in diameter.Take a portion of paneer filling and place it in the center.
