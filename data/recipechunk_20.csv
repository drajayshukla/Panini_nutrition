As soon as the mix cools down slightly, grease your palms with a dash of ghee and start kneading the mix.

Place the dough on it and roll the dough out with a rolling pin to a thickness of 5-6 mm, evenly.Place a saucepan with water on the heat. Place a heat proof bowl over it and melt the dark chocolate over it. The heat generated in the boiling water beneath will melt the chocolate gradually.

After about 6-7 minutes they will begin to crisp up.Transfer these okra onto a plate and set aside to be used later.In the same pan heat the remaining oil and warm it. Add mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds, asafoetida, curry leaves and red chillies in quick succession and let them crackle and crisp up.Once done add the besan next and saute lightly till the besan gets well coated with the oil, and browns evenly.
