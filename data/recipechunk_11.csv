Enure the shell does not break. Keep the shell aside.Peel the think skin of the pulp, remove any seeds and cut the pulp into tiny pieces and keep this aside.The next step is to condense the milk to make the Kulfi. For this heat milk in a heavy bottomed saucepan and bring the milk to a boil.Once the milk comes to a boil, turn the heat to low and simmer the milk with almost continuous stirring and reduce the milk to more than half its quantity. It is important to note that during the initial stages of milk condensation frequent stirring is important, but as it begins to start condensing and reaches less than half the quantity it is absolutely important that you stir continuously.This is because condensed milk tends to get stuck to the bottom and sides of the pan and burn; leading to a very unpleasant taste. Burning of milk is also toxic so you want to be extra careful.Once it is reduced to about more than half of its quantity stir in the sugar until it dissolves completely. Once it does, allow the kulfi milk mixture to cool completely.Once the Kulfi cools, stir in the orange marmalade and the orange pulp mixture into the condensed kulfi mixture. Pour the Orange kulfi mixture in the orange shells you kept aside or you can also set in another bowl and later serve the orange kulfi in the orange shells. I prefer the later method, as it is easier to scoop the orange kulfi like an ice cream and put it in the shells and serve it to your friends and family.Note: Freeze the orange for at least fifteen hours or more to set well. Serve the Orange Kulfi Recipe as an cold indian dessert for parties or during the festival of Holi or simply make for the summers and enjoy it with your family.
