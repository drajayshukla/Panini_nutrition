Cook for 5-6 minutes, stirring constantly, or until the strawberries become soft and mushy, and have released their juices.Add in the sugar and cornstarch stir vigorously to avoid forming lumps.  Continue to cook - and stir - for another 1-2 minutes. Remove pan from heat when the mixture thickens up and transfer the filling into a small bowl. Set aside.*To make the dough:In a pan, add the milk and heat on low flame for 1 minute until it becomes lukewarm. Turn off the flame. Now add a pinch of sugar and yeast to the lukewarm milk and stir it for few seconds. Keep aside undisturbed for 10 minutes or until froth appears on top of the milk. While adding the yeast to the milk, ensure that your milk is lukewarm and not hot, because if it is hot then chances are that your yeast will die.In a separate bowl, add sugar, egg, salt, melted butter, and the milk-yeast mixture. Whisk until all ingredients are well combined.Start adding the flour, 1/3rd at a time, and gently mix it with a spatula. Mix well, until a thick, sticky dough forms and all the flour is incorporated.Dump the dough on a well-floured surface and knead just until the dough is no longer sticky and forms a ball.This will take about 10-15 minutes.Alternatively you can even knead the dough in a food processor .Place the dough into a greased bowl.

Grind the soaked rice, coconut and salt in a blender adding water little at a time to make a smooth batter. It is important to add a little water at a time to grind the rice into a smooth batter. When you feel the batter between your fingers it should be smooth and not coarse.Once the Neer Dosa batter is ground, transfer it to a large bowl. Add enough water such that the dosa batter has a smooth flowing consistency. The consistency of the batter should be such that the batter has a very thin coating at the back of the spoon and not a thick coating. If if forms a thick later, then the you need to add a little more water. Grind the whole spices - Coriander Seeds, Cumin Seeds, Methi Seeds and Dried Red Chillies as well to a smooth paste by adding some water and add into the batter.Check the salt levels and adjust to suit your taste.The Neer Dosa batter is now ready to be made. The Neer Dosa is made very similar to the Rava Dosa.To make the Neer Dosa, we don’t spread it on the pan like a pancake or a regular dosa. We pour the dosa batter on the hot pan and it will spread itself creating holes.Note: It is a good idea to use an iron pan, as the texture and the softness of the dosa comes out perfectly with an iron pan.To begin, make sure you have a greased and seasoned iron pan. Grease and preheat the iron pan until it is sizzling hot. When you sprinkle water on the pan; the water will sizzle and evaporate.Once you have the right heat on the pan; pour a ladle of the batter in a circular motion starting from the outer edges. The batter will sizzle and flow to spread itself. Fill in the batter where there are gap, but do allow the dosa to have a few tiny holes. There is no need to sprinkle oil to cook the Neer Dosa.The Neer Dosa cooks very quickly; when you notice the top of the dosa is no longer raw, the Neer Dosa is cooked and has a rich white colour. The cooking process will take less than 30 seconds per dosa.Slide a flat spatula from the sides of the pan and fold the Neer Dosa into a half and then into another half to form a triangle. Place the Neer dosa on a platter and continue to make Neer Dosa’s the similar way.Make sure you place the Neer Dosa’s away from each other when they are hot; as they tend to stick to each other. Once they cool down, you can place them one on top of the other; into a covered bowl and serve warm.Serve the Spicy Neer Dosa Recipe along with kori gassi Recipe,Bean Sprout & Corn Salad Recipe by the side.

When you feel the batter between your fingers it should be smooth and not coarse.Once the Neer Dosa batter is ground, transfer it to a large bowl. Add enough water such that the dosa batter has a smooth flowing consistency. The consistency of the batter should be such that the batter has a very thin coating at the back of the spoon and not a thick coating. If if forms a thick later, then the you need to add a little more water. Grind the whole spices - Coriander Seeds, Cumin Seeds, Methi Seeds and Dried Red Chillies as well to a smooth paste by adding some water and add into the batter.Check the salt levels and adjust to suit your taste.The Neer Dosa batter is now ready to be made. The Neer Dosa is made very similar to the Rava Dosa.To make the Neer Dosa, we don’t spread it on the pan like a pancake or a regular dosa. We pour the dosa batter on the hot pan and it will spread itself creating holes.Note: It is a good idea to use an iron pan, as the texture and the softness of the dosa comes out perfectly with an iron pan.To begin, make sure you have a greased and seasoned iron pan. Grease and preheat the iron pan until it is sizzling hot. When you sprinkle water on the pan; the water will sizzle and evaporate.Once you have the right heat on the pan; pour a ladle of the batter in a circular motion starting from the outer edges. The batter will sizzle and flow to spread itself. Fill in the batter where there are gap, but do allow the dosa to have a few tiny holes. There is no need to sprinkle oil to cook the Neer Dosa.The Neer Dosa cooks very quickly; when you notice the top of the dosa is no longer raw, the Neer Dosa is cooked and has a rich white colour. The cooking process will take less than 30 seconds per dosa.Slide a flat spatula from the sides of the pan and fold the Neer Dosa into a half and then into another half to form a triangle. Place the Neer dosa on a platter and continue to make Neer Dosa’s the similar way.Make sure you place the Neer Dosa’s away from each other when they are hot; as they tend to stick to each other. Once they cool down, you can place them one on top of the other; into a covered bowl and serve warm.Serve the Spicy Neer Dosa Recipe along with kori gassi Recipe,Bean Sprout & Corn Salad Recipe by the side.",https://www.archanaskitchen.com/spicy-neer-dosa-recipe
