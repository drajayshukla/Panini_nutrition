Butter and flour a 10"" loaf, square, or a bundt pan. I like using a loaf pan as the cake slices nicely.Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt and keep aside.Using the large bowl or a KitchenAid Stand Mixer bowl, beat together the (butter) oil, sugar and vanilla essence, add in the eggs (eggless: Flax Eggs) and milk (Vegan: almond milk) and beat until well combined. Finally add in the flour mixture and beat until well combined.Pour the batter into the prepared greased pan and bake until a knife inserted in the centre comes out clean, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. The baking time will vary from oven to oven, so take care too look at it after 30 minutes.Allow the cake to cool completely. Bake the pound cake recipe in a round spring foam pan. First, prepare the sugar syrup. Combine all the ingredients for the syrup, stir well until the sugar dissolved. Keep this aside.Next, we will prepare the cream frosting. In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk the cream along with the sugar until it becomes light and fluffy and forms soft peaks. Once the cream forms soft peaks, add in the mascarpone cheese and whisk until just about combined. Keep this aside.Now we will begin to make the cake in layers. Slice the cake horizontally into half. Carefully lift the top later and place it down. Drizzle the sugar juice syrup to both the cake halves. This makes the cake moist and juicy. Place the bottom layer on a cake platter or a serving plate. Using a cake spatula, apply the frosting mixture and spread evenly on the bottom half of the cake. Lay the chopped fruits like kiwi, pineapple, oranges generously on this layer of cream.Next place the second half the cake over the fruits and lightly press it down with your palms. Spread the remaining frosting smoothly with a palate knife or a back of a spoon all round the cake including the sides. Using the back of the spoon, give the cream frosting a little spike by pulling the spoon away from the frosting.  This gives a neat and yet uneven look to the cake. Finally lay the remaining fruits on the top of the cake and just splash the almond slivers to the sides of the cake. The French Gâteaux Recipe (Layered Fruit and Cream Cake) is now ready.Refrigerate the cake for a couple of hours or over night or until the next day for your parties.

In a large bowl add whole wheat flour and some salt. Add water a little at a time and knead to make soft, pliable dough. Knead dough for a couple of minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth.Next we will add a teaspoon of oil to coat the dough and knead little more. You want a dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky.Next we will divide the dough into 6 equal portions and keep aside.While the dough is resting, lets prepare the filling for the parathas. In a large bowl; add tofu, onion, chopped methi leaves, green chillies, cumin powder, and salt. Combine all the ingredients well.Divide the filling into 6 equal portions. This process of dividing and keeping the portions of dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.Take a paratha dough portion dust it in flour and flatten it on the rolling board by pressing it down. Roll the dough out into approximately 3 inch diameter circles dusting with flour in between to prevent the dough from sticking to the surface. Place this rolled dough to the side.Take another dough portion, dust it with flour again and roll into approximately 3 inch diameter circle.Now place a portion of the tofu methi paratha filling onto the circle and spread it evenly around. Next, take the other rolled portion of the dough and place it over the filling.Press and fold the edges so that the filling does not come out while cooking the tofu methi paratha. Once sealed press down the tofu methi paratha with your palms to release any air pockets.And give it a gentle roll with the pin to even it out. Proceed the same way with the remaining paratha dough and filling portions.Now we will get into the final steps of cooking a tofu methi paratha, preheat a skillet on medium heat and place the filled dough.Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over. Add this stage add a teaspoon of ghee or oil and spread it around the tofu methi paratha.Flip again, so the oiled side of the tofu methi paratha can cook on the skillet. Spread a little more ghee and keep pressing the tofu methi paratha while on the skillet to cook the paratha evenly from inside out.Do the flipping over process a couple of times until both sides get cooked, browned and crisp evenly. Make sure you cook on medium heat as it allows the tofu methi paratha to get a crisp on the outside and yet have soft texture.Once the tofu methi paratha is cooked transfer it to a plate and serve.Serve the Tofu Methi Paratha Recipe along with a Tomato Onion Cucumber Raita Recipe and Pisarna Manga Recipe  for breakfast, lunch or dinner.
","To begin making the Tofu Methi Paratha Recipe, we will first make the dough for the parathas. In a large bowl add whole wheat flour and some salt. Add water a little at a time and knead to make soft, pliable dough. Knead dough for a couple of minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth.Next we will add a teaspoon of oil to coat the dough and knead little more. You want a dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky.Next we will divide the dough into 6 equal portions and keep aside.While the dough is resting, lets prepare the filling for the parathas. In a large bowl; add tofu, onion, chopped methi leaves, green chillies, cumin powder, and salt. Combine all the ingredients well.Divide the filling into 6 equal portions. This process of dividing and keeping the portions of dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.Take a paratha dough portion dust it in flour and flatten it on the rolling board by pressing it down. Roll the dough out into approximately 3 inch diameter circles dusting with flour in between to prevent the dough from sticking to the surface. Place this rolled dough to the side.Take another dough portion, dust it with flour again and roll into approximately 3 inch diameter circle.Now place a portion of the tofu methi paratha filling onto the circle and spread it evenly around. Next, take the other rolled portion of the dough and place it over the filling.Press and fold the edges so that the filling does not come out while cooking the tofu methi paratha. Once sealed press down the tofu methi paratha with your palms to release any air pockets.And give it a gentle roll with the pin to even it out. Proceed the same way with the remaining paratha dough and filling portions.Now we will get into the final steps of cooking a tofu methi paratha, preheat a skillet on medium heat and place the filled dough.Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over.

Let it soak for about 6 hours.First grind the urad dal into a fine smooth batter. While grinding add just enough water to make it into a very very smooth batter. The batter will look fluffy. Pour this batter into a large container.Grind the rice into a smooth paste, adding just the required amount of water to grind into a almost smooth batter. Adding too much water will make the dosa batter too watery. If required grind a little at a time to get a almost smooth batter .The rice batter is a little coarser, but the urad dal batter is super smooth.Combine the urad and rice batter, add salt to taste and set aside for at least 12 hours or overnight until the batter ferments. You will notice the batter would have risen in volume.Hence you should place the batter in a large container so it has enough room to increase in its volume.Note on fermenting the Idli Dosa BatterFermenting has to take place where the weather is warm.
