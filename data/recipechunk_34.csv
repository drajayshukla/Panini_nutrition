Punch, press and pull the dough together kneading it continuously till it forms a firm, but soft dough.Knead well for a minimum of 5 to 7 minutes so that the dough is smooth. Apply a little bit of oil all over the dough and cover it with a wet towel. Set it aside in a warm place for 3 to 4 hours to rise a little bit.

Knead it for 3-4 minutes, then roll out the dough into a long cylinder and cut it into 8 individual portions.Rolle acc of the portions into a ball. Taking one ball at a time, flatten it out with your fingers to form a small disc about 3 inches in diameter.

The kulcha will be slightly thicker than a usual chapati due to the stuffing. Take care not to let the stuffing ooze out of the kulcha.Next, wet your palms with a little water and pat one side of the kulcha with it. Sprinkle a pinch of ajwain seeds and chopped coriander leaves over it and press down so they stick to the kulcha.Warm a skillet or tava on a medium heat.

Sprinkle the reverse side with ajwain and chopped coriander as well.When little bubbles begin to form on the surface, flip the kulcha over to cook the other side. Repeat until both sides are browned evenly.When ou take the kulcha off the tava, liberally apply butter or ghee over it and stack them for serving.Repeat the procedure for the rest of the rounds made and all the kulcha are cooked.Serve hot along with Chole Pindi and a simple Mooli Raita or Salad for a quick wholesome lunch or dinner.
","To begin making the Aloo Kulcha Recipe first prepare the dough. To do this, sieve the all purpose flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and sugar together to combine them.Add the curd and oil to it. Combine it with your fingers. Next add the lukewarm water a little bit at a time while kneading the flour together. Punch, press and pull the dough together kneading it continuously till it forms a firm, but soft dough.Knead well for a minimum of 5 to 7 minutes so that the dough is smooth. Apply a little bit of oil all over the dough and cover it with a wet towel. Set it aside in a warm place for 3 to 4 hours to rise a little bit. You can do this in a just-warmed oven, if you live in a cold place.In the meantime, prepare the stuffing for the kulcha. Mash the boiled and peeled potatoes, in a mixing bowl.Add salt, green chillies, coriander powder, cumin powder, grated ginger, chat masala, red chilli powder, garam masala, coriander leaves and mix well with your fingers till it is a evenly combined potato mixture.Now, to prepare the Aloo Kulchas, turn out the dough onto a work surface dusted with a little flour. Knead it for 3-4 minutes, then roll out the dough into a long cylinder and cut it into 8 individual portions.Rolle acc of the portions into a ball. Taking one ball at a time, flatten it out with your fingers to form a small disc about 3 inches in diameter. Take a spoonful of the spicy potato filling, place it in the centre of the disc.Bring the edges of the dic together into the centre and seal the filling inside to make a stuffed dough ball.Flatten it down slightly with your palm, and using a little flour for dusting, roll it out gently with a rolling pin to make a thin round about 5 inches in diameter. The kulcha will be slightly thicker than a usual chapati due to the stuffing. Take care not to let the stuffing ooze out of the kulcha.Next, wet your palms with a little water and pat one side of the kulcha with it. Sprinkle a pinch of ajwain seeds and chopped coriander leaves over it and press down so they stick to the kulcha.Warm a skillet or tava on a medium heat. When it is hot enough, place the kulcha on it, wet side down.Now, wet your palms again and pat the other side as the kulcha cooks on a medium heat. Sprinkle the reverse side with ajwain and chopped coriander as well.When little bubbles begin to form on the surface, flip the kulcha over to cook the other side. Repeat until both sides are browned evenly.When ou take the kulcha off the tava, liberally apply butter or ghee over it and stack them for serving.Repeat the procedure for the rest of the rounds made and all the kulcha are cooked.Serve hot along with Chole Pindi and a simple Mooli Raita or Salad for a quick wholesome lunch or dinner.",http://www.archanaskitchen.com/aloo-kulcha-recipe-spiced-potato-stuffed-indian-flat-bread
