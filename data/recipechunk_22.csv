Once cool make small marble sized balls of the mix and set aside.To prepare the rest of the Kachariyu, in a pan or kadai lightly toast sesame seeds, coconut, almonds and melon seeds.While it is still warm transfer the mixture to a grinder add jaggery and grind finely.To this, add the dried ginger powder, cardamom powder and nutmeg powder. Pulse it again a couple of times till it mixes well.You will notice that the sesame seeds and coconut has released its oil and the mixture gets crumbly. If held in a fist the mixture should come together lightly.

When the milk comes to a roaring boil, add orange juice, orange zest and vinegar. The milk will curdle immediately. Turn off the heat and let the curdled milk rest for 3-4 minutes in its whey.After about 3 to 4 minutes, strain the curdled milk onto a cheesecloth or a cloth strainer. Let it drip and drain until all the whey has drained out and we have thick cottage cheese (chenna). This will take a few hours. So proceed to the next steps once the chenna is ready.Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 liter milk in a heavy bottom pan and cook on medium heat till the milk has reduced to half. Keep stirring the milk occasionally to prevent the milk from getting settled at the bottom of the pan.Once the milk has reduced to half its quantity, add the 1/2 cup sugar, a pinch of orange color and orange essence to the reduced milk and keep this aside. Pour the reduced milk into a serving bowl which is large enough to hold the cooked chenna balls.Once the chenna is ready, we will proceed to shape the chenna. Place the chenna into a bowl, add arrowroot powder and a pinch of orange color to it. Mash the chenna with the heels of your palm till smooth. The process is more like a kneading and mash technique that makes the chenna soft. Continue with the knead and mash motion until the chenna feels soft.Once the chenna is soft, shape the chenna into 12 to 15 small balls and flatten them slightly. Keep these balls aside.The next step is to cook the chenna - yes its double cooking process to get the spongy nature of the cottage cheese balls in the Ras Malai.To begin, heat water and 1-1/2 cup sugar in a pressure cooker. Stir well until all the sugar has dissolved completely. When the water comes to a rolling boil, add a few chenna balls in the pressure cooker. Cover the lid, place the weight on and cook the chenna balls for 2 whistles on high heat.Remove the pressure cookerAfter the two whistles, turn off the heat, place the pressure cooker under running water to release the pressure immediately. The process of placing the pressure cooker under cold water ensures safety when releasing the pressure.Once you open, you will notice the Chenna Balls would have puffed up and expanded. Remove the cooked chenna balls using a slotted spoon and add them to the reduced milk.Cook the remaining chenna balls in the same manner and add them to the reduced milk. The Orange Rasmalai is now ready to be refrigerated.Place the Orange Rasmalai in the refrigerator for at least 5-6 hours and then serve them as a dessert for parties.

","To begin making this Vegan Guilt Free Chocolate Espresso Mousse Recipe, first melt the chocolate in a microwave safe bowl.Place all the dark chocolate in the bowl and microwave it at 20 seconds intervals until it has just melted.Take care not to overheat the chocolate. Once melted, remove it from the microwave and give it a quick mix. Set it aside in the bowl to cool down a bit.While the chocolate is melting, make a coffee decoction as below or prepare the espresso in a coffee machine using fresh coffee beans.To make the decoction add 1/4 cup warm water to 4 tablespoons of instant coffee powder and stir well to make a coffee decoction.When ready, and the chocolate has cooled, add coffee decoction to melted chocolate and mix it well.Next add the ripe bananas, ripe avocados, melted chocolate with coffee, cocoa powder and sugar into a blender and blitz into a smooth paste. Do not add any water at this stage as we want the mixture to be thick. This will help it set like mousse.Transfer the fruit and chocolate espresso mixture for the mousse into 6 individual serving cups or a large serving bowl and chill it in the refrigerator, until it is set (about 8 hours). Pouring it into individual bowls will help set it faster, whereas a big serving bowl may take a while longer.While the dessert is getting set we will proceed to make the Vegan Coconut Milk Whipped Cream. To make the Coconut Whipped Cream, it is important for the coconut milk to be refrigerated for 6 to 8 hours. This refrigeration process helps thicken the coconut milk. Remove the excess liquids after refrigeration and use only the solids. Using a cloth mesh strainer will help separate the whey.Place the refrigerated coconut milk in a chilled mixing bowl, add the icing sugar and vanilla essence. Using an electric beater, whisk until it forms stiff peaks. Refrigerate this coconut cream until you are ready to use it.When you are ready to serve, garnish the Vegan Chocolate Espresso Mousse with whipped coconut milk cream and some chocolate shavings.Enjoy the guilt free Vegan Chocolate Espresso Mousse at the end of a Weekend Dinner or Dinner Party.Serve Vegan Guilt Free Chocolate Espresso Mousse Recipe as dessert after a meal of  Loaded Veggie Nachos Recipe - A Delicious Mexican Appetizer and Red Bean Mexican Burrito Bowl Recipe - Roz Ka Khana With Figaro Olive Oil.
