In a large bowl add in 2 cups of whole wheat flour and some salt.Use your fingers and stir in the salt into the flour. Add little water at a time and knead to make soft, pliable paratha dough. Knead paratha dough for a couple of minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth.Next add a teaspoon of oil to coat the paratha dough and knead little more. You want a paratha dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky. Divide the dough into 8 to 10 equal portions. Cover the dough and allow the dough to rest until you get the filling ready.Pressure cook arbi with 1 cup water and salt for around 4 whistle and switch off the heat.Once it is pressure cooked, allow the pressure to release naturally and peel the skin.Mash the arbi into a coarse lumpy texture with your fingers or a fork.

Roll them out thin to approximately 3 inches in diameter circle.Take a portion of filling and place it in the center. Next Gather the sides of the paratha dough and bring them together.

Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over.Add this stage add a teaspoon of ghee or oil and spread it around. Flip again, so the oiled side can cook on the skillet.

Then, add chilli flakes and oregano, toss together and turn off the heat. Keep aside till ready to use.For the roasted corn salsa, char the corn on the stove top or in a preheated oven. Take the kernels off the cob and put it in a bowl.Add in the rest of the ingredients and mix thoroughly. Keep aside until later use.For the guacamole, prepare the Avocado guacamole but remember that guacamole needs to be eaten fresh, so this is one component that has to be made last, or just before assembling and serving the burrito bowl.To assemble the burrito bowl, if you are preparing one big bowl for your guests, use a fairly deep 8-9” flat bottom bowl or serving dish.A burrito bowl is essentially layered, so begin with the coriander-lime rice. Spread it generously at the base of the bowl.Over it, spoon the spicy beans and spread it around the rice.Next, layer the sauteed peppers over the beans.On top of that goes a layer of guacamole.Spread some corn salsa over it, and top it with the lettuce (if using), cheese and black olives and serve.If you are making individual burrito bowls for a smaller crowd, follow the same sequence of layers, but use smaller sized ramekins for serving.To make a Burrito Bar, simply place all the prepared components on convenient location. Give your guests individual bowls and allow them to choose their favorite toppings to assemble the bowls of their choice.To serve it as a warm winter casserole, once assembled, bake the bowl in a preheated oven at 180 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes and serve hot with baked Tortilla chips.Serve the Mexican Vegetarian Burrito Bowl for a wholesome dinner followed by a dessert of Apple Enchiladas. ",http://www.archanaskitchen.com/mexican-vegetarian-burrito-bowl-recipe

This takes about 2 minutes.Cover for a couple of minutes and let it cool until you can handle the mixture.Drop it on an oiled surface and knead well after wetting the hands with water. Moist and freshly washed hands are required since the dough is sticky.Knead for about 5-7 minutes to get rid of lumps if any and to smoothen the pre-cooked flour.Roll the mixture into a cylinder and divide them equally. This should give you about 4 equal sized balls.Keep them covered at all times. Knead each ball for 15-20 seconds and roll it out just like regular ujju rotis using rice flour to dust. Just make sure you do it slow and steady since the edges might crack.Roll out all the balls and stack the roti one on top of another on a plate first and then start roasting them. Use a little rice flour in-between each, to avoid getting stuck to one another.Heat a Tawa and cook the Ujju Roti just like a chapati by smearing oil /ghee on both sides. Cooking will take 1-1.5 minutes on each side.Serve Karnataka Style Ragi Ujju Roti with Steamed Vegetable in Coconut and Lentil Curry or your favorite chutney like Heerekai Sippe Chutney or Kadale Chutney Recipe.",https://www.archanaskitchen.com/ragi-ujju-rotti-recipe

Add the butter and mix the butter into the flour with your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add in a tablespoon of ice water at a time and knead to bring the flour together.Knead to form a firm dough that is firm and does not break apart when you try to press it. Make sure you only add a tablespoon of water at a time, as the warmth of your hand will help bring the flour together to form a dough. Wrap the pastry crust dough in cling wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.After 30 minutes, roll out the pastry dough on a lightly floured surface. Roll it out to make a circle of 12 inch diameter that is about 1/4 inch thick. Lift the dough carefully from the floured surface and place it in a 9 inch tart pan with a removable base.Press the dough into the pan so it fits tightly; press the edges into the sides of the pan. It is important to press the dough evenly into every nook and corner of the pan's ring. Remove the excess dough that is hanging off the sides of the pan. Place the tart crust in the freezer for atleast another 15 minutes. This process of chilling the crust, helps make the crust flaky when baked.Prebaking the Tart CrustPreheat the oven to 180 C. Once the oven is preheated, Prick the chilled tart crust with a fork, so it does not puff up while in the oven. Cover the tart crust with foil, place pie weights or beans on the crust and prebake the crust for about 25 minutes. The tart will look golden brown but not completely baked. Remove the tart crust from the oven and allow the oven to be on at 180C.Remove the foil and pie weights/ beans and keep the crust aside while we prepare the filling.Method for Chocolate FillingWhisk the eggs in a bowl until light and flully. Keep aside.To make the chocolate filling for the tart, place the heavy cream and milk in a sauce pan over medium heat, add in the chopped chocolate and keep stirring on low heat till you see the chocolate melting half way through. Turn off the heat and proceed to melt the chocolate into the milk and cream mixture in the existing heat. Add in the sugar and salt and whisk the chocolate cream mixture until well combined.Next add in the whisked eggs into the chocolate cream mixture and whisk it in well until well combined. The chocolate cream filling mixture is now ready to be poured into the tart crust.Pour the filling into the tart crust and place it back into the oven and bake for about 15 minutes until the filling is set and the surface is glossy. If you see any bubbles or cracks forming on the surface, take the tart out right away as this indicates that the tart is getting overbaked.Keep monitoring the Chocolate Tart while its in the oven, as the baking times differ from oven to oven. It is important to monitor so you don't over bake the chocolate.Remove the Chocolate Tart from the oven, and allow it to cool completely. Refrigerate the Chocolate Tart for about 8 hours until set and serve it along with fresh fruits, like strawberries.Serve the Chocolate Tart Recipe as a Dessert for a Get together Party to amuse your guest.
