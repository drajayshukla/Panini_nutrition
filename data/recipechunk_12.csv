Refrigerate the pie dough for a couple of hours.While the pie dough is refrigerating, we will proceed to make the mushroom pie filling. To make the pie filling,  heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan, add the onion and saute until it gets browned and close to caramelized. The caramelized flavor of the onions, brings out the delicious taste in the Mushroom pie.Once the onions are browned, add the garlic and the mushrooms and saute on high heat until the mushrooms get cooked through. The mushrooms release a lot of water while cooking as well. Allow the water from the mushrooms to evaporate. Once done, add the salt, pepper, basil and cream. Stir well to combine. You should have a thick mushroom mixture. If you feel it's a little more liquidy, then add a teaspoon of cornflour to thicken the mushroom pie filling. Turn off the heat and keep aside.Once the pie dough has firmed well in the refrigerator, it's time to roll and shape them into pies.You can bake the mini pies in large muffin moulds or pie tart pans. Grease these moulds with butter and keep aside. Preheat the oven to 180 C.Dust the kitchen platform with flour and roll the pie dough into a large rectangle. Roll the chilled dough on a floured work surface, and cut 10 cm circles with the help of a cookie cutter. The circle should be the size that will fit into the pie pan or the muffin pan.Once you have cut out the circles of dough, press one circle into each mould cavity till the edge and cut off the rest. If you think the dough is bigger and tends to fold inside the cavity, pinch the dough well so that it merges well. Do this with the remaining pie dough as well.Spoon the mushroom pie filling into each of the pie dough cavities. The next step is to cover the top of the pie with dough.To cover the top you will need more dough, so just measure the top and use a cookie cutter of that size to cut out the dough. Roll out the remaining dough, and stamp out circles  and use these circles to cover the top of the pie. Pinch the sides of the bottom and the top dough to seal the pie from all sides. Make small insertions with a knife on the top of the pie to help release of air while the pie is baking.Now beat an egg, and brush over the edges of the pastry dough, also brush the pastry lid and pinch both them together. Also brush the top of the pastry lid with the egg wash and sprinkle sesame seeds from top. If you want to make it eggless, you can use milk as well. Bake the Mushroom Pie in a preheated oven for 28 to 30 minutes at 180 degree celsius until you notice the crust is browned, golden and crisp. Once done, remove from the oven and allow it to rest for 10 minutes before you are ready to serve.Serve the Creamy Mushroom Pie along with a bowl of Lemongrass Soup, a Garlic Bread and a glass of wine for a weeknight dinner or even when you have friends over for parties.
