In this recipe, I will show you how to cook using a pressure cooker. If you dont use a pressure cooker, then I suggest the same cooking procedure, using a heavy bottomed sauce pan with a lid. You will cover the pan after the procedures below and cook until the millets or broken wheat is edible.Into a pressure cooker, heat a tablespoon of oil. Add the ginger, green chillies, bay leaves, cardamom pods and stir-fry for a few seconds. After which, add in the turmeric powder, cumin powder, tomatoes, salt and the millet. Add 2 cups of water (sometimes if the millet or broken wheat is old- then it might need more water). Stir all the ingredients and cover the pressure cooker (or the saucepan). Place the weight on and pressure cook until you hear 2 whistles.After a couple of whistles, turn the heat to low and simmer for another 3 minutes. After a couple of minutes, turn off the heat. Allow the pressure from the cooker to release naturally.  If using a saucepan, make sure you cover the pan and cook until the millets are done to suit your taste.Once the pressure is released, open the cooker, stir all the ingredients. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.If, by chance the millets did not cook with the amount of water you added, then sprinkle some more water as required, cover the pressure cooker and allow it to steam on low heat. Don't place the weight on at this stage. You will have to just cover and cook.Next we will stir fry the spinach in wok and then add it to the cooked millet. In a wok, add a teaspoon of oil, add the chopped spinach, salt and stir fry on medium heat until the spinach is cooked and almost all the water is evaporated. Stir in the spinach to the cooked millets. Once the Spinach and Millet Pulav is done, stir in the ghee. You can skip adding ghee on top if you are not very keen on that. Ghee adds an additional flavor to the Pulao making it delicious. Serve the Spinach and Millet Pulav along with a Raita of your choice.

You will notice that the crust has a golden brown and is crisp from the edges.Note: If you don't want to use the egg, then you can mix a tablespoon of milk and honey and using a brush, smear it all over the crust. This process will also give the crust a light golden finish.Once the oat pie crust is baked, remove it from the oven and allow it to cool completely.  We will now proceed to prepare the Yogurt filling for the baked pie crust. In a large bowl, beat the eggs and sugar for 3 to 4 minutes till pale and thick.Gently fold the yogurt mixed with zest, vanilla extract, nutmeg powder into this until well combined. Sieve the flour into the yogurt mixture gradually in three batches, folding it while you go along. Take care not to over beat the yogurt, as it will have a tendency to become thin.Once the flour is combined well, pour the mixture into the pre-baked tart, arrange the fruits in the center and put it back into the oven to bake at 170 C for about 30 to 35 minutes till the edges start to turn golden brown and the mixture looks set. When you shake the pie pan, you will notice only the center wobbles a little but over all the pie will be set.Once you notice this, remove the pie from the oven and cool completely. Once the pie is cooled, refrigerate the pie for at least 6 hours before you are ready to serve. Note: If you plan to make this eggless (egg free), then omit the egg and the baking process after that.Combine the yogurt, sugar, vanilla, nutmeg powder along with 2 teaspoons of agar agar or gelatine (dissolved in very little water). Add the agar agar mixture to the yogurt and combine it well. Pour the mixture into the prebaked tart crust, top it with fruits and refrigerate until it is set. Once it is set the pie is ready to be served.Serve the Baked Yogurt Tart Recipe with Figs & Blueberries Recipe(With Eggless Recipe Option) up at tea-time or at your next dinner party.
