Cover the dough and keep aside.In the same food processor jar, attach the chopper blade. Add the chicken and blend to make a fine mince of the chicken. Keep aside.The next step is to make the chicken keema samosa filling. Heat oil over medium heat in a pan; add the ginger, garlic, green chillies and onions and saute until the onions soften.Once the onions soften, add the red chilli powder, garam masala powder, amchur powder, chaat masala powder, minced chicken and salt.Saute the  chicken keema along with the spices until the chicken is cooked.

Once done, stir in the mint or coriander leaves and stir and allow it to cool.The final step is to make the chicken keema samosa.Fill a small cup with water and keep aside; this will be used for sealing the edges of the cone. On a floured surface, roll each portion into 6 inch diameter circle and cut each circle into half.Spread the water lightly all along the edge of the semicircle. Fold the semicircle into a cone shape and seal the side edges and not the opening of the cone. Pick the cone up in your hands.Fill the cone with one or two tablespoons of potato filling. Press this filling down gently into the cone with your fingers. Now close the top of this cone into a triangle shape, pinching the top edge so that it is completely sealed. Continue to make the chicken keema samosa the similar way.Heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan for deep frying on medium heat; gently slip in a couple of chicken keema samosas into the frying pan and allow them to fry on medium heat. Turn the samosas around in the oil once they come floating to the top. Fry them till they turn into a light golden-brown colour on all sides. Keep the heat on medium all along.High heat can brown the crust faster but not make the crust crispier.

It takes just about 4 minutes to cook the chicken. Once the chicken is cooked, you will notice it resembles an egg scramble.Turn off the heat at this stage, check the salt and spices and adjust to suit your taste. Once done, stir in the mint or coriander leaves and stir and allow it to cool.The final step is to make the chicken keema samosa.Fill a small cup with water and keep aside; this will be used for sealing the edges of the cone. On a floured surface, roll each portion into 6 inch diameter circle and cut each circle into half.Spread the water lightly all along the edge of the semicircle. Fold the semicircle into a cone shape and seal the side edges and not the opening of the cone. Pick the cone up in your hands.Fill the cone with one or two tablespoons of potato filling. Press this filling down gently into the cone with your fingers. Now close the top of this cone into a triangle shape, pinching the top edge so that it is completely sealed. Continue to make the chicken keema samosa the similar way.Heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan for deep frying on medium heat; gently slip in a couple of chicken keema samosas into the frying pan and allow them to fry on medium heat. Turn the samosas around in the oil once they come floating to the top. Fry them till they turn into a light golden-brown colour on all sides. Keep the heat on medium all along.High heat can brown the crust faster but not make the crust crispier. Continue the procedure with the remaining filled chicken keema samosa and drain them on absorbent paper.Serve Chicken Keema Samosa as a snack with Dhaniya Pudina Chutney and Date Tamarind Chutney as a delicious evening snack for the rainy day/ monsoons.",http://www.archanaskitchen.com/chicken-keema-samosa-recipe

","To prepare Baked Masala Dal Vada recipe, soak chana dal and urad dal  for 3 -4 hours.Keep some 2 tablespoon separately and grind the dals separately in a mixer by straining any excess water. Grind it to a coarse mixture and take it out. Mix the ground dal along with onion, mint, coriander, curry leaves, fennel seeds, salt and hing. Adjust the seasonings and mix the dals that you had kept separately to make the batter a bit thick such that it holds together while shaping.Heat a kadai with enough oil to fry, add a drop of the batter to check if it is hot before frying. Take the vada mix and make them into patties with hand and carefully drop them into the oil. Use a skimmer to keep turning the vadas and fry them on both the sides till it is golden brown. Take them out and drain it over the tissue paper or a paper napkin and serve. Serve this Masala Dal Vada recipe with Masala Chai on a damp and rainy evening to get the best feel out of it! You can also pair it up with a creamy Paal Payasam Recipe (Rice Kheer/Pudding).",http://www.archanaskitchen.com/baked-masala-dal-vada-recipe
