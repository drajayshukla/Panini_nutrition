Mix all the ingredients until the apples are well coated and combined.To make the crust:To make the crust by hand, combine the flour, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. Work the chilled butter into the flour with your fingers until the mixture resembles a coarse sand. Sprinkle ice water onto the crumbly dough and with your hands push the dough from the sides to the middle of the bowl to form a ball that holds together.Add just enough water to bring the dough together. There should not be too much moisture in the dough and the dough should be firm.Divide the dough into two, cover in cling film wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours. To make the crust in a food processor, add the butter and place them in the bowl of the food processor. Add the flour, salt and sugar. Process until all of the ingredients are incorporated.With the processor on, add the ice water a tablespoon at a time until the dough begins to clump but is still crumbly.

Fold the overhangs over the edges sealing them together.Combine the milk and honey in a bowl and brush the top of the apple pie, this gives a good colour to the crust. Finally, cut small slits to act as vents all over lid so the steam can escape through and retain just the enough moisture needed for the apple pie.Place the pie crust in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown for about 40 to 45 minutes.After about 45 minutes when you notice that the crust is golden, it indicates that the apple pie is ready.

Take care the bowl of eggs does not touch the water. Using a whisk, keep whisking to cook the egg yolks until it is light in color, fluffy and looks almost doubled in volume. Once you get that consistency, immediately remove eggs from the heat. Keep aside.Keep the saucepan that has water in simmering heat, as we will now melt the chocolate. Place the chocolate in a bowl and place it over the simmering pan and melt the chocolate until smooth and creamy. Remove the chocolate from the heat and keep aside.The final step is to whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. In a large mixing bowl, add the egg whites and using a clean dry whisk, beat the egg whites until light, fluffy and have formed white stiff peaks. Do not over beat.Gradually to the egg white mixture, fold in the egg yolks and the chocolate mixture alternatively and finally fold in the whipped cream to complete the mousse.Arrange 6 to 8 small juice glasses. Place a spoonful of chopped pineapple at the bottom of each glass. Top it with the Chocolate Mousse Mixture and then set it to firm in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours.Once the Mousse is set and when you are ready to serve, top it with the remaining chopped pineapple and serve. You can optionally top it with whipped cream or mint sprigs and serve.Serve the Homemade Chocolate Mousse With Pineapple as a dessert after a meal of Roasted Vegetable Lasagna Recipe, Fizzy Pomegranate Mint Mocktail Recipe.

Immerse each rice wrapper completely into the water and allow it to rest in the water for about 30 seconds. You will notice the wrapper begins to soften. Carefully remove the rice wrapper from the water and spread it on a wooden board.Our next step is to make the spring rolls. Place the filling in the center of the soaked wrapper. Place only a little at a time, as you will need enough place to shape it into a spring roll. To shape the roll, first fold the both the sides of the wrapper over the filling, then roll the wrapper from the bottom towards the top until all the wrapped is rolled through. Lift carefully and arrange the roll on a platter.Continue this process of soaking, filling and shaping the rice wrappers and arrange them on the serving platter and cover with a damp muslin cloth. If you plan to serve them later, cover the platter with a cling wrap so the rice paper spring rolls don't dry out.Once you are ready to serve, remove the cling film, slice the Vegetarian Rice Paper Spring Rolls into half and serve it along with Peanut Chilli Dipping Sauce.
