The electric pressure cooker is a great piece of equipment - as you can set the time and simply continue to do your work, without worrying about waiting for a whistle etc. Heat a bit of oil in the pressure cooker pan. Add the mustard seeds and allow it to crackle. Once it crackles, add the curry leaves, asafoetida, the brinjal and sprinkle of salt. Saute the brinjal until lightly done, as the pressure cooker will cook it deeper anyways. Next add the turmeric powder and the vangi bath spice mix, the rice, salt and finally 2 cups of water. Give it a stir and lock the lid of the pressure cooker and Lock lid in place. Turn the weight and set it into pressure mode. Since it’s rice, I am going to set it to the rice/biryani mode and set the vangi bath to cook.  Once the pressure builds up, the timer will get set and the rice will get cooking. When timer beeps, the pressure goes off into a keep warm mode and the pressure will slowly release. You will know the pressure is released completely when the pressure indicator comes down. At this stage you can open and give the one pot vangi bath a stir and serve.Serve Vangi Bath with Burani Raita or any other Raita of your choice for a quick weeknight dinner or even pack it into your lunch box.
","We begin making the One Pot Vangi Bath Recipe, we will start by roasting of vangi bath spice powder. Place a pan on medium heat and roast condiments well until you get a good aroma. Once the spices are roasted, allow it to cool down and then blend it in a spice grinder. Blend the spices in the Zodiac spice mixer grinder.  The next step is to make the vangi bathFirst, we will stir fry the brinjal and cook it until soft and then add the spices and the rice and cook it in a single pot. The electric pressure cooker is a great piece of equipment - as you can set the time and simply continue to do your work, without worrying about waiting for a whistle etc. Heat a bit of oil in the pressure cooker pan. Add the mustard seeds and allow it to crackle. Once it crackles, add the curry leaves, asafoetida, the brinjal and sprinkle of salt. Saute the brinjal until lightly done, as the pressure cooker will cook it deeper anyways. Next add the turmeric powder and the vangi bath spice mix, the rice, salt and finally 2 cups of water. Give it a stir and lock the lid of the pressure cooker and Lock lid in place. Turn the weight and set it into pressure mode. Since it’s rice, I am going to set it to the rice/biryani mode and set the vangi bath to cook.  Once the pressure builds up, the timer will get set and the rice will get cooking. When timer beeps, the pressure goes off into a keep warm mode and the pressure will slowly release.
